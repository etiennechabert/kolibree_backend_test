        <b>First impression about this test</b>

        <p>
            First of all I would like to apologize for the deliver delay of this test.</br>
            I was in a rush during my last month of work, and needed a break a the end of my previous contract (last wednesday).</br>
            I began this test Saturday, and work on it with an average of 3H / Day for a total arround 10-12h of work</br>
            It was a bit painful to be honest (my first run with Django) ;) Exceptions were sometimes a bit hard to understand and fix, the framework looks pretty strict (this is a good point for me)</br>
            </br>
            I will be happy to talk with you about the choices I made, even if I am not totally confident about them ;)
            </br>
