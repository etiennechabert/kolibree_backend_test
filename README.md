Difficult start, I wasted time to setup my environment properly, my IDE was stucked on python version 2.6.9 and it toke me a while to figure how to fix it. 

I choosed to work with mysql during this projet.

Then I toke my time (about 40min) to understand all the possible type for the model definition and what was their possible options.

I am going to explain this choices here : 
NB : For a reason I decided to setup blank=False for every field even if it's the default comportment, I feel it more readable this way.
 
I decided to create 2 tables :
*  User : based on your requirement
*  UserToken : This table will be used to keep record of the user authentications.
  *  A foreign key to the User (The relation is 1-N, I want to keep a record of all authentication)
  *  The token field is a UUIDField, I am not 100% sure about what is it for, but it looks to be able to genreate unique 32 chars long string what is good for my need ;). 
  *  The creation_datetime field is ... a datetime ;) this value will be automaticly set to 'now' on the creation (if auto_now option works as I expect). My idea is to create a DEFINE to setup how long a token is valid and to use relative DateTime comparaison to check if the token is still valid or not
